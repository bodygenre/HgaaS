# HgaaS
Mercury as a Service


## Idea

Mercury as a Service is a web-based resource for communication thru programming.

Astrologically:
```
Mercury uses its clever intellect and relentless curiosity to analyze, sort, and classify, helping us synthesize and articulate complex ideas.
```

## Implementation

HgaaS provides web-based syntax-highlighted code editors, a way to explore and discover current modules, and a way to view process logs. 

HgaaS provides a process-manager that restarts the process when files are modified, restarts the process when it crashes, restarts the process 
periodically (for cases where the process hangs), and produces rotating log files.

## Blowhardiness

HgaaS is a tool that will improve human-human relations through programming languages and shared simulative and productive environments. 

HgaaS is the future of math. 

Mercury 4eva.
